      "full": "El Cadejo is a legendary supernatural dog from Central American folklore, existing in two opposing forms: the White Cadejo (benevolent protector) and the Black Cadejo (malevolent attacker). Described as large dog or wolf-like creatures with glowing red eyes, shaggy fur, and sometimes chains or hooves, these spirits appear to lone travelers at night. The White Cadejo protects travelers and guides the lost, while the Black Cadejo attacks drunkards and sinners, potentially driving victims to madness. The legend varies across Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, serving as both a cautionary tale and a source of comfort for nighttime travelers. The phenomenon remains an active part of Central American folklore and cultural tradition."
